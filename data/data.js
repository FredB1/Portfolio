        summary: "During my time at Way Too Tech, I had the opportunity to showcase my Full Stack Development skills in creating responsive and user-friendly websites for a diverse set of clients. Working closely with our customers, I took their ideas and brought them to life through the creation of custom WordPress plugins and themes that met their specific needs. \\n To achieve this, I utilized a variety of cutting-edge technologies such as WordPress, PHP, CSS, and MySQL. Through the use of WordPress, I was able to create websites that were both intuitive and easy to navigate. With PHP, I was able to customize the functionality of our websites, and with CSS, I was able to create visually stunning designs that were tailored to our customers' unique branding requirements. Additionally, I utilized MySQL to create and manage databases, which allowed for seamless data management across all of our websites. \\n As a Full Stack Developer, I took on a range of responsibilities throughout the project lifecycle, from requirements gathering to deployment. I worked closely with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to ensure that all requirements were met, and all deliverables were completed on time and to the highest standard. \\n My experience at Way Too Tech has allowed me to develop strong skills in Full Stack Development, including problem-solving, project management, and communication.

        summary: "As a Frontend Developer for Care Courses, I was tasked with creating an interactive accordion UI for a client's website without using JavaScript, as a third-party company managing the site did not allow JavaScript code. Through the use of HTML and CSS alone, I was able to successfully design and implement an accordion UI that opened and closed smoothly, providing an enhanced user experience. \\n Additionally, I was able to consolidate 50% of the website's pages using only HTML and CSS, reducing the amount of code required and improving the site's loading speed. This allowed users to access content faster and provided a more efficient browsing experience. \\n Overall, my work on this project demonstrated my strong skills in Frontend Development, including my ability to design and implement interactive UI elements using HTML and CSS. I am confident that my technical expertise in CSS and HTML would make me a valuable addition to any team.",
